# Introduction
We seek to provide a functional rest-api based webapp to access various dictionaries stored in a database. We intend for the database to serve a huge, eclectic mix of dictionaries which are not already available in a single spot.

## Motivations
* Any web developer should be able to make simple REST-API calls to our backend to easily get entries for a lot of dictionaries (most of whom aren't already available in such manner).
* End users ( sanskrit students and scholars ) should be able to thoroughly investigate a term in the dictionaries using just a browser, without having to install any software.
